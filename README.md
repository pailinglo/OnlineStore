After following Mr. Venkat's ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Tutorial (https://csharp-video-tutorials.blogspot.com/2019/11/aspnet-core-razor-pages-tutorial.html)
and impelemted the previous project per the tutorial, I created this online store website using the same technologies.

Other web technolgies involved:
